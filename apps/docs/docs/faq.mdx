# FAQ

## What's the compatibility story?

All Legacy Plugins (React Components) are compatible with Lexical Builder!

Lexical Builder Plans are _only_ compatible with editors created using the
Lexical Builder API (`buildEditorFromPlans`, or an abstraction that uses
it internally such as `LexicalPlanComposer`).

See the [Migration Guide](./migration) for more detailed examples!

## Why is it called a Plan instead of a Plugin?

Legacy reasons. Historically, Lexical has used the term Plugin to refer
to a React component that adds behavior to the editor. Transitioning
this word to another meaning would be confusing.

It would also be a tricky transition for public APIs, since the ideal
names for exports are already taken, so the legacy Plugin and the new
Plan could not be colocated if they were both called Plugin!

## What about lazy loading?

Lazy loading does not need any special support!

For an example of how to do lazy loading in Vanilla JS, see the `register`
property in
[EmojiPlan.ts](https://github.com/etrepum/lexical-builder/blob/main/packages/lexical-emoji-plan/src/EmojiPlan.ts).

Lazy loading in React could be as simple as using `React.lazy`, see
the Component output in
[BuilderGraphPlan.tsx](https://github.com/etrepum/lexical-builder/blob/main/packages/lexical-builder-devtools-core/src/BuilderGraphPlan.tsx)

*Note:* The Plan itself must be synchronously imported before creating the
editor. Lexical needs all editor configuration (including nodes) up front.
This is no different than without Lexical Builder. The Lexical core would
need significant changes to allow configuration changes to an editor at
runtime.

## How do we prevent all of the frameworks from being loaded?

Vanilla JS and React have first class support in Lexical. Lexical Builder
provides a path for Plans written for either of these to be loaded into
any editor regardless of what framework the page is using.

When you depend on a Plan that depends on `ReactPlan`, you will get a runtime
error if a React provider is not present (`LexicalPlanComposer` or
`ReactPluginHostPlan`). Think of it like an unsatisfied but required peer
dependency. This way you won't get confused if you add a plan that requires
React but it never renders correctly because React isn't set up properly.

Other frameworks can use the functionality exposed by Lexical Builder
to provide their own integrations in a similar way. Supporting
`DecoratorNode` subclasses in multiple frameworks is not currently
supported, or planned to be supported, because I am pretty sure that
you can use mutation listeners for the same purpose. Perhaps the
decorate method could even be deprecated at some point!

## How will this interact with Lexical Dev Tools?

All of the Builder metadata is present at runtime, but we would need
to have some well known place to store the LexicalBuilder instance
(perhaps `__lexicalBuilder` on the rootElement) so that the dev tools
could access it. There are many things that could be done, here are
a few examples:

* Show a diagram of the Plan tree
* Track which config came from which Plan (e.g. which node, which theme
  property, etc.)
* Track which commands/listeners/etc. were registered by which Plans
  (would require editor instrumentation)
